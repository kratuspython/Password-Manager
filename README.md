Password Manager

This project is a Password Manager app built with Python and Tkinter. The main purpose of this project is to help store and manage login credentials (website, email/username, and password) in a safe and organized way.

Features

Password Generator: Creates strong and random passwords with letters, numbers, and symbols.

Save Function: Stores website, email, and password into a data.json file for later use.

Search Function: Lets you quickly search for saved login details for a website.

Clipboard Copy: Automatically copies generated or retrieved passwords to the clipboard for easy use.

User-Friendly Interface: Built with Tkinter to make the app easy to use without needing the command line.

Goal

The goal of this project was to practice working with Python libraries like Tkinter, JSON, and pyperclip while building something useful. It also gave me hands-on experience with file handling, error handling, and creating a simple GUI application.
